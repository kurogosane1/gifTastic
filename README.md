Using the giphy API to create gifs.

The giphy Api is a fantastic way of finding giff's of what you are looking for. 
You shall see a list of options already availble to find on the top. But lets say you want to find something particular. Then you can enter in the search box and a new button would be created where the user can then click and find giffs for that name.
